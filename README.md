# WeatherApp
In the HTML file (index.html), there is a basic structure with a title, an input field for the user to enter the location, and a container to display the weather data.

The CSS file (style.css) is responsible for styling the elements of the WeatherApp. It sets the font-family to sans-serif, centers the WeatherApp container both horizontally and vertically on the page.

The JavaScript file (script.js) handles the functionality of the WeatherApp. It listens for changes in the input field (#location-input), retrieves weather data for the specified location using an API key obtained from a registered account on a weather service website, and displays the weather data in the designated container (#weather-data). Additionally, it includes a function (getBackgroundColor) to change the background color of the weather data container based on the temperature.

Overall, the WeatherApp project provides a user-friendly interface for accessing weather information, making use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality.
